
#Poor security practice #1
The web application instance is in a public subnet and should be in a private subnet.
 
#Poor security practice #2
The policy attached to the instance role does not apply least privilige. It should only allow reads fron the S3 bucket "Free Recipies" instead 
of 's3:*' in resource '*' (all s3 actions on all resources) which the web app instance and the attack instance currently have. 
 
#Poor security practice #3
The security group is too porous. The security group for the web app instance should only allow tcp traffic from the load balancer on port 5000, 
not 0.0.0.0/0 (all IPV4). The web app should egress traffic through a NAT gateway, not directly. 
     
#Poor security practice #4
The S3 buckets lack server side encryption and versioning. 

#Poor security practice #5
S3 buckets do not block public access.The bucket "Secret recipe vault" should have "block public access" selected and should use an 
access control list that limits access to privileged business users.
