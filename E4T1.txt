Changes that would prevent the SSH brute force attack:
Do not expose port 22 or allow SSH by changing the security group. We can use systems manager to access the instance instead.
Do not allow password access through SSH by changing the sshd_config file or updating ssh config
through cloud formation (should have been launched this way).
Only allow ingress to the instance from the load balancer on port 5000 by updating the security group
and use AWS WAF in front of the load balancer.


Preventing access to the data in the S3 secret bucket:
Default encryption should be turned on and any unencrypted objects should be encrypted.  
Public access to the secret recipe bucket should be blocked and the access control list should 
only allow access for the authorized/authenticated users of that bucket which does not include the web app instance.
The web app instance role should also be changed to limit it's S3 privilige to read only, and only the free recipe bucket.
