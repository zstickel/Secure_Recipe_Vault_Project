Tools that would allow me to scan Infrastructure as code templates:
Open Source Tools: Cfripper, Cloudsploit, cfn-lint. For terraform you can use Chef inspec, Regula, or Terrascan.
Example compliance violation or vulnerability the tools would expose: Infrastructure allows an instance to have
full access to a resource that is not in compliance with policy (such as allowing full access to S3 when your rule only 
allows read access).

Tools that would allow me to scan AMIs and containers:
AMIs - AWS Inspector
Example compliance violation or vulnerability the tools would expose: Discover that SSH password login is allowed.

Containers - Open source tools such as Claire, Anchore, Trivy; commercial products such as aquasec, sysdig, or twistlock.
Example compliance violation or vulnerability the tools would expose: Detect and report on a CVE and provide the CVE number
and description such as CVE-2019-5736 which would allow a malicious container to overwrite the host runc binary and gain root
level code execution. 

Tools that would allow me to scan the AWS environment for vulnerabilities:
AWS Config, Guard Duty, Inspector. Open source tools such as Prowler, Scout2, Cloudsploit, or commercial products such
as Fugue, Palo Alto Prisma, CloudConformity, etc. 
Cloud Trail with VPC flow logs, bucket logs, config logs, EC2 server logs, and DNS logs should all be enabled. They can 
be investigated with a SEIM tool such as Splunk.
Example compliance violation or vulnerability the tools would expose: Server side encryption not enabled. SSH brute force attack
has been conducted.
